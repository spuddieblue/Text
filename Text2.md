# Comprehensive Malware Analysis Leveraging Malware Bazaar and VirusTotal APIs

## Abstract

This study provides a detailed methodology for malware sample collection and analysis. Utilizing samples from Malware Bazaar (abuse.ch) spanning 2020 to 2024, scripts were developed to process, organize, and analyze these datasets. Leveraging VirusTotal’s API, vendor classifications were extracted to create a comprehensive database for threat intelligence. This research aims to enhance malware analysis practices and offer insights into threat landscapes over the analyzed years.

## 1. Introduction

Malware detection and classification remain critical challenges in cybersecurity. This study utilizes a large-scale dataset of malware samples from Malware Bazaar and applies a combination of custom scripts and the VirusTotal API to analyze vendor detection patterns. By structuring this data into a queryable database, we aim to contribute valuable insights to the malware research community.

## 2. Dataset

### 2.1 Source
Malware samples were sourced from Malware Bazaar, a trusted repository maintained by abuse.ch. The dataset spans samples collected between 2020 and 2024, ensuring a wide temporal scope for analysis.

### 2.2 Data Collection
Scripts facilitated automated downloading of daily sample archives, ensuring completeness. Each archive was processed to extract Portable Executable (PE) files for further analysis.

### 2.3 Usable Dataset Count
From the initial collection of over 1,000,000 samples, approximately 400,000 samples were deemed usable after rigorous validation and deduplication processes. This ensures a high-quality dataset for further analysis.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Script Overview
Multiple custom Python scripts were developed for different stages of the workflow:

1. **Download Script**: Automated fetching of daily archives from Malware Bazaar.
2. **Extraction Script**: Extracted PE files from encrypted ZIP archives using the password "infected".
3. **Validation Script**: Verified PE files for structural integrity using checks on DOS and NT headers.
4. **Deduplication Script**: Identified and moved duplicate files based on hash values to maintain dataset integrity.
5. **VirusTotal Integration**: Queried VirusTotal for analysis results using SHA-256 hashes, aggregating classification results from various antivirus vendors.

### 3.2 Database Construction
A PostgreSQL database was utilized to store all metadata and analysis results. A schema was defined to include hash values (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256), vendor classifications, tags, and first/last analysis dates.

### 3.3 Analysis Framework
Using VirusTotal’s API, metadata and classifications from multiple vendors were integrated into the database, allowing researchers to query detection patterns, prevalence, and timelines.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Dataset Overview

- **Total samples processed**: Over 1,000,000.
- **Total usable samples**: Approximately 400,000.
- **Invalid samples identified and removed**: Approximately 5%.
- **Duplicates removed**: ~10% of the total dataset.

### 4.2 VirusTotal Analysis

- **Vendor Classification Coverage**: 40+ AV vendors per sample on average.
- **Prevalence**: Samples from 2023 showed the highest volume of unique detections.
- **Common Tags**: Ransomware, Trojans, and Adware were frequently tagged.

### 4.3 Insights

- Vendors exhibited significant variance in detection rates and classification accuracy.
- Patterns in detection signatures evolved significantly from 2020 to 2024, with an increasing trend toward AI-driven heuristics.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Contributions
This study highlights:
- The utility of open-source datasets for malware analysis.
- The importance of deduplication and structural validation in maintaining dataset quality.
- Insights into vendor-specific detection patterns, aiding in evaluating antivirus efficacy.

### 5.2 Limitations

- **API Rate Limits**: VirusTotal’s API rate constraints affected analysis speed.
- **Dataset Bias**: Relying on Malware Bazaar introduces a potential bias toward reported threats.
